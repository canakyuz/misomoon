# Install misomoon on Ghost

Add the misomoon script tag to your Ghost site. It takes about two minutes.

Copy your script tag from **Settings** > **Install** in the dashboard. It looks like this:

```html
<script defer src="https://analytics.example.com/m.js?s=your-site"></script>
```

## Add the script

1. Open **Settings** > **Code injection**.
2. Paste the tag into **Site header**.
3. Select **Save**.

## Check it works

Open your site in a browser. You appear in **Live** within a few seconds. If you
don't, the browser console says why, for example `misomoon skipped: bot`, and
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) lists the other causes.

## Next steps
